# Sunsetter_R1_Plates

The files given are the R1 plates for the Sunsetter. Feel free to use them however you'd like, expect R2 to have an updated plate though.

Thickness should be 1.5mm or 1.6mm.

The DXF file can be used to laser-cut plates, .step can be used for testing fits or CNC'ing the plates

The POM file is a flipped version of the regular one, this was done so that when the POM was laser-cut one side would be perfectly flat (the top side) and the other side would have the tiny raised edges that occurred from laser-cutting.

Original Plate Options for Sunsetter were Brass (Default), Aluminum, Carbon Steel, and POM.
